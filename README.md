# Postman as code public roadmap

âœ¨ðŸ¦„ View the [official pmac public product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/postman-as-code/projects/1)

The product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you.

The roadmap repository is for communicating pmacâ€™s roadmap.

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **feature** that indicates the feature or product to which the item belongs. For a list of current features, see below. 

- Once a feature is delivered, the **shipped** label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the relevant changelog.

## Release phases

- **in design:**\
Feature in discovery phase. We have decided to build this feature, but are still figuring out _how_.

- **exploring:**\
Feature under consideration. We are considering building this feature, and gathering feedback on it.

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. 
Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next. 
Be sure to read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline.  
You'll also find an **Exploratory** column, which is used in conjunction with the **in design** and **exploring** release phase labels for when no timeframe is yet available.


## Feature Areas

The following is a list of our current product areas:

- **file-system:** pmac internal files management
- **configuration:** pmac configuration options
